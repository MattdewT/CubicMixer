'''
There are a lot of different method to dispense a defined amount of liquid. To make this wide range of different method 
available for the user, the source code got separated in his own module to be defined by the user himself. 
In this use case air pumps are used to force the liquid out of solid containers. Therefore a compensation of the empty
pipe is additional necessary.

class Tank:

    The class Tank represents a cylindrical container, with defined base area and volume. Each tank links to its own
    valve and can be distinguish by their position. To make the fluid dispensation even more accurate, a compensation
    for the pipe was added.
